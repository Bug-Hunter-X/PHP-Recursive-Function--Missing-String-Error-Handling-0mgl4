This repository demonstrates a common but subtle error in PHP recursive functions: the lack of explicit error handling for unexpected data types within the processed data. The `bug.php` file shows a recursive function that processes an array.  If the array contains a string value including the substring 'error', it causes a failure.  The improved version in `bugSolution.php` adds a check for string values and performs a string replacement to address the issue.  This simple addition prevents crashes and provides more robust error handling.
